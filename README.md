# thermostat-js

Exercise - TDD a thermostat operated via the browser (localhost) using JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS and Jasmine as the testing suite. It also integrates with the openweather API to display the current temperature in the user's location - as long as the user is in London.

## Getting Started

Download the project and unzip, then double click on myThermo.html to open in the browser - you're up and running! Try pressing some buttons.

By all means play around with the code itself. Presuming, if you have the urge to do this, that you have some knowledge of programming and JavaScript, you probably already have everything you want to use installed. The only real prerequisite is Jasmine (which you likely already have), to write and run tests - for comprehensive installation instructions, have a look at https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine.

## Running the tests

To run the tests, just open SpecRunner.html in a browser.

### Testing

This is currently halfway through the weather API being implemented, so test coverage is patchy and a little untidy. I'm due to polish and improve the testing once I get a chance to revisit the project.

## Built With

* [JavaScript](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/)
* JQuery - the library used to make the webpage dynamic
* HTML/CSS - front-end template and styling
* [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) - Testing Suite
* [OpenWeatherMap](http://api.openweathermap.org) - Used to zpull in current weather data
